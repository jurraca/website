There's something distinct about the American political conscience from its European counterparts, and I had sensed it before, but now it's up in my throat.
Americans of all times, including ours, have never known fascism at home. Never seen it gain seats in power or sweep through your neighborhoods and congressional districts.

As an American who was raised in France, the lack of instinct for fascism on both left and right has been stunning.
We talk about how awesome WWII was like it was a football game, without even understanding a shred of what we were fighting.
The left is quick to call out fascism from the right yet fail to self-investigate, or witness the same speech arise in their slogans.

In Europe, the scars are real. They're in family trees, in mortared hills, in ancient churches patched up, on the skin of my friends' grandparents who survived the death camps.
These things are not abstract like they are in America, and this why America is getting seduced by an authoritarian figure who remakes the system to his liking while cutting democracy at the knees. I suspect he's just laying ground for a future balls-to-bone authoritarian.
It comes down to a lack of experience. Sorry America, but in the realm of political regimes, we have barely scratched the surface.

Any country can pull its soul through these kind of momentary & collective insanities, but not without pain--real pain--and a strong civic backbone. Talking with 20-30 year olds today, the lack of civic and political education is drastic.
The 20-30 year olds who ascribe to either side of the political aisle don't want, or know how to, have a conversation with someone they disagree with. And without this, we will not survive the rise of fascism in America.

I guess I have to specify that fascism and nationalism are not the same thing. Nationalism--pride in your country and its people and the common history that binds them--is often leveraged in a fascist movement, since it's an abundant resource of a nation's collective unconscious. But in no way does fascism require nationalism to succeed, and nationalism does not imply fascism. This is today's Left's myopia, that anything close to patriotic, or traditional in the sense that it has existed for more than 5 years, is a problem.

Being able to navigate this ideological landscape without falling prey to the memes and slogans has been earned through death and destruction in our nations and families. So when that kind of talk raises its head, as it is wont to do in the sinews of history, Europeans intuitively sense danger. Americans have not developed this trait, if it can be called that. It is unclear whether one can acquire this trait without one's culture experiencing it and integrating those experiences. Some lessons can only be learned through experience, and if we are to ever be a *United States* again, it will be on the other side of this painful experience.
