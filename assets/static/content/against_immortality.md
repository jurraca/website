*"All this neon is ripping us up inside / Immortality's out of bounds, it's a one-round ride."*

Run The Jewels, "Yankee and the Brave", *RTJ4*

*"Maybe time running out is a gift"*

Jason Isbell, "If We Were Vampires", *The Nashville Sound*

*"Immortality means an eternity living with what we've done."*

Tanaseda Hideki, S2Ep4 Altered Carbon

There exists a strong current in Silicon Valley that deems immortality to be the Holy Grail of technological progress, most recently expounded by Balaji Srinavasan in his post ["The Purpose of Technology"](https://balajis.com/the-purpose-of-technology/). As off-base as most accusations of privilege in the tech community have been recently, I find the argument here completely out of touch not just with the rest of world, but with humanity and the purpose of technology itself. I think it comes from a stance common with high-agency peak-performance types: "If only I had enough time, I could be fulfilled and make the world a much better place". Longevity and life extension are of course hugely important directions of progress, and it seems inevitable that we will see radical leaps forward in these areas.
But there's a much more impactful goal right at hand that Silicon Valley refuses to face head-on: we should help people live *better* lives, not live longer lives full of pain, lack of meaning, and isolation.

What you need to realize is that most people don't live better lives if they live longer. In fact, most people go through life as drudgery, pain, and frustration.

Another fact: most people are dead long before we bury them.

They get older and give up because the world has taken enough from them and they just want to be left alone. The problem isn't decay or senescence. It's not therapeutics. The problem is that the life unlived has become the default: 9 to 5, for work that leaves a writhing hole in your heart as you try to make ends meet and hope inflation doesn't erode your savings too quickly. You want life extension? Build pathways away from traditional schooling and 9-5s. Build technology that empowers instead of sucking one's attention into a screen while assisting large-scale spying. Help save lives.

Solve for meaning, not time.

I, personally, would rather live 20 years of meaning and fulfillment than 100 years of aimlessness. I'm not alone.

So, what is the purpose of technology? It is indeed, to reduce scarcity. And Time is the fundamental scarce resource, for every living thing in the universe.
But by eradicating death or senescence, we don't guarantee that this immortality will be a fulfilling one. The literature is full of these stories: Dorian Gray, the Methuselahs of _Altered Carbon_, Jim Jarmusch's fantastic *Only Lovers Left Alive*, Netflix's *The Old Guard* more recently. If we make immortality as the *telos*–the thing we aim for–of technology, we will give up on gifting humanity the fire it needs most: meaning and empowerment, in _this_ life.
Make no mistake, we will develop this technology. It's within reach. But it will not be free. And it will not be open source. It will be priced just right for the discerning overlord.

Can you imagine, with the current social stratification, what immortality would mean? The power not just to cause someone a lifetime as a slave – an eternity as one.

Simply put, the second part of Balaji's article should have come first. We need technological progressives, and their visions, now. We need it so that when we reverse aging, it won't be a *product*.

Is Death good? No. Are we ready for immortality? Not even close.
