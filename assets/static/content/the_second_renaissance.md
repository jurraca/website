From Robert Pirsig's *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* (1974):

> "We're living in topsy-turvy times, and I think what causes the topsy-turvy feeling is inadequacy of old forms of thought to deal with new experiences. I've heard it said that the only real learning results from hang-ups, where instead of expanding the branches of what you already know, you have to stop and drift laterally for a while until you come across something that allows you to expand the roots of what you already know. Everyone's familiar with that. I think the same thing occurs with whole civilizations when expansion's needed at the roots."

> "… the whole Renaissance is supposed to have resulted from the topsy-turvy feeling caused by Columbus' discovery of a new world. It just shook people up. The topsy-turviness of that time is recorded everywhere. There was nothing in the flat-earth views of the Old and New Testament that predicted it. Yet people couldn't deny it."

This is where we're at, in the maw of a great change in the common knowledge of our societies. It feels less like a righteous wave of creative destruction and more like the moment everyone at a party becomes aware of a couple yelling at each other in a corner of the room, the collective narrative shattered, the awkwardness mutating into a vague nausea across the room, the immediate desire to heal a rift by making it disappear. For us this narrative change is currently playing out in grueling slow motion, the biochemistry of "does not compute" rolling through our society and individual central nervous systems. The mind, the body, and body politic all recoil at our situation: uncertainty, lack of pattern, sedentary living.

The Renaissance came about differently, but the dynamic is the same. There was a nice little religiously-centered, mercantile society coming out of many centuries of war. Your world view, your knowledge of the world, is given to you, and cannot be questioned. The human mind feels at home in these certainties.

Gradually, then suddenly, everyone knows that we have found a new continent; there was a whole continent there, and we had no idea!

# "It just shook people up."

The Church was infallible, and if it left out something like the extent (and shape) of the world, then suspicion is immediate and irrevocable. This is how a narrative crumbles: with a common knowledge event that the predominant narrative didn't dictate.

The second effect of such an event is that the vacuum it leaves gives rise to one of the most in-compressible urges of humanity: imagination. With such a large canvas as a “New World”, it would be criminal not to rise to the occasion. The Church agrees readily with this. But imagination overflows the banks of what the Church can prescribe. Ensues a lasting period of questions, exploration, and invention.

# “Stop and drift laterally”

Not many people involved in the Renaissance ever made it to the Americas, or got reliable information about the land. The echo of that common knowledge event resonated through the markets and academies of the world enough to spark the aggressive exploratory spirit of the Renaissance. The knowledge itself was enough.

This is happening again, now. I have a sinking feeling that we are never going back to the way things were before, for better or for worse.

We've come to find our world on the brink, and the hits keep coming: Hong Kong, Brexit, Epstein, coronavirus, Fed printing the equivalent of 60% of GDP in 4 weeks, oil markets imploding, proto-UBI from a Republican administration, the Navy declassifying UFOs, I mean...

To say the capital-N Narrative is decohering doesn't do our times justice. The Narrative is undergoing a chain reaction of hematomas. And we are waiting, hoping a new narrative will emerge that can make better sense of the world for us.

We crave a signal in this noise, and yet I see in the eyes of others that most have given up. They won't help build a different future. They won't push back against an encroaching state. They won't root themselves in their independent thought. They will follow, and suffer–as long as they can suffer together.

We need new narratives or there will be more anger and unrest. We need to chart alternative paths, and fast.

This is the hard part. It won't be fun to live through, just like the birth pangs of the Renaissance. It will take a fair bit of psychological strength to reinvent the map of our society as its legacy structures begin to fissure. It will be difficult and thankless work. The alternative, however, is a rather ham-fisted dystopia.

The difference with the Renaissance is that we don’t have a New World to harness our dreams to: our New World will be something else entirely.
