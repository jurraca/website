To whomever,

If you're about to step out of high school, or in your early twenties, this year must have been quite a lot to take in. Just as you may be trying to understand the world and your place in it, the world's social structures and institutions seem to be crumbling, which may leave some of you confused, angry, despondent, and perhaps fundamentally depressed. You're not alone there.

I remember what it's like trying to figure this dynamic out in a world that, in my mind, had gone off the reality tracks (post 2010).  The reason I'm writing this is that this is one of those times where everything changes very quickly, and it can be a bit overwhelming to try to figure yourself out at the same time. So I want to give you a few clues and insights that may help about how to navigate this decade as a young person and spare you some research and thinking. I've been observing our ongoing trainwreck in slow motion–as have many others to whose insights I am indebted to–and we are about to be in the thick of it. And most of the rules are out the window.

So, the hard part is that most of what you've been taught about society, economics, geopolitics, medicine, technology is certainly going to get either transcended or completely thrown out the window in the coming decade. Your parents and the experts have no idea what they were talking about, mostly. Learn to unlearn what has been made irrelevant.

Work is now non-localized and asynchronous. You should expect to be able to do something, fail at something, succeed without a manager over your shoulder. Self-responsibility.

You're not going to have one career. Your career will be a sum total of all the patchwork (or mosaic) professional experiences you can have in one life. This is a good thing. You can be a full human! Astrophysics-brewer-mom. Product manager - poet - social organizer. CEO - aikido master - school teacher. Whatever. There are no rules.

Bio. Robo. Crypto.

Consider yourself part of the human race, not just a nation or your town. We have a global and instant communications network. We have automatic translation and common narratives. We have a global money--Bitcoin. We have a common life, planet, and purpose.

Your health–physical, mental, emotional–is your most important asset. Most people never learn the basics, like learning to breathe. They just roll with the default setting and never learn to control their breath to control their state of being. Find whatever self-care practice works for you. For me it was Taiji. For others its (western) yoga, or boxing, or skateboarding. Dancing. Learn to exercise self-care protocols in your life.
Beware the substances people approve of. Everything is a chemical, and some of the legal ones are more dangerous than the illegal ones. Try not to be dependent on any chemistry–remember that mental strength is built from inward out, not from outside in. You should not be afraid of chemistry–try stuff–but be careful what you choose to help you cope. As someone once said "we all get caught up in the things we do to cope."

The economic rules are about to be rewritten. If you're a monetary history nerd, this is your Superbowl. Most people have no idea we are undergoing a tectonic shift in the nature and scope of economic relationships between individuals, communities, and nations.

If you go to college, understand that you are buying a credential with the university's name attached. That can open you doors, but it is not a substitute for knowledge or skill. Understand: you can learn anything and everything online. Better: you can get the best teacher of them all online, teaching to 1 million students.
I learned more in the years after college than in my entire life before, because I realized that I still loved learning, and that if you poke your head out of the class-test-grade hamster wheel, the world's knowledge is truly free and there waiting for you to get interested. The sooner you get on that mindset the better.

Find the others. Whatever your tribe is. They're out there, and they need you, just as bad as you need them.

Often repeated, seldom integrated: if it's free, you're the product. Understand that social media and public media are merchants of attention, and the more attention you give them, the more it changes your brain. The chemical dependency here is dopamine. And the addiction and its aftereffects are very, very real.

This moment in history we're living through is the changing of the guards, from the boomers to the millenials and zoomers. No one lets go of power easy, and no one asking to take power is 100% good. Yet it must happen. The Wheel turns. As someone who's watched the non-progress of the last 15 years with much frustration, we are eager to get moving again. That doesn't mean it won't be extremely painful, heart-wrenching, and scarring for all of us. Go forth anyway.
