  As you work from home, you stay static more. You interact with others less. You move less. You sit longer, often interacting with a screen, which alters and stresses your posture in unfamiliar ways. Without a doubt, this period of containment is going to impact your physical and mental health significantly. Please hear me out: you are going to have to exercise self-care.

The greatest risk to your mental health is losing the connection with your body. For the more active of us, containment is torture. For the less active, your posture will continue to degrade, losing its structure, its elasticity, its vitality, simply because you're stuck at home, sedentary. The effects of containment on a person aren’t choices so much as the inevitable result of a change in daily environment, and they will impact everyone differently. In the face of potential months of more sedentary life, it is imperative that we build new habits to compensate.

I’m going to share some old ideas that we’ve inherited as the practice of Tai Chi (or Taiji). I find people often have the wrong impression of what Taiji is, but I’m sharing this because I think it is uniquely suited to our present predicament. Tai Chi is self-care, regular maintenance for your physical structure and how your mind relates to it. I find it easier than meditation because it’s a fundamentally physical practice, and a pretty approachable routine. The main idea is to turn the mind inward, into the bones, tendons, muscles and breath that form the body, to continuously strengthen the connection with the mind.

The physical foci of taiji are twofold: the skeletal structure of the body, and the fascia that lines it. In the west we call fascia "white issue" and overlook it entirely as mere connective tissue. This will one day be looked upon as a terrible oversight. In various forms, fascia connects muscle to skin, organs to themselves, and is also present as a thin layer below the dermis that runs all over the body. It's mostly made of collagen, storing fat and water. Under a microscope it can be wavy when well stretched or messy, like steel wool. It is elastic, and can be a conduit for kinetic energy.

In Taiji, we speak of "whole body movement". What this means is to understand energy moves around the body via this network of tissue.

A [fascia primer](https://taichionlineclasses.com/tai-chi-fascia-connective-tissues/):
> "Fascia is made up of fibrous tissue that contains closely packed bundles of collagen, like a thin membrane that connects everything within the body, a continuous web of hollow, fluid filled strands.  It’s the body’s natural shock absorber, a spring of energy that surrounds and connects every structure in the body.  These elastic tissue work much like a tensegrity balls rubber bands. They connect the wood pieces together in such a way that the pieces of wood (bones) never touch each other which would create unwanted compression.  In much the same way, fascia in the human body creates a matrix of elastic bands for our bones to float in, protecting each and every part of the body individually from impact. This self-aware matrix of elastic bands relays information to the brain faster than our nerve impulses."

This also means taiji uses no muscular force whatsoever. All power comes from gathering of energy within the body and redirection of forces outside the body. There are things that can be done with taiji that cannot be done with muscular force. To many it is the core of martial arts and the common ancestor to most forms we know today.

Try this: stand with your feet aligned with your shoulders, with your weight evenly distributed. Most of us lock our knees, and pitch slightly forward. Instead, tuck your tailbone slightly, as if you were about to sit on a barstool. Feel your abdomen tight? Let it go, loosen your stomach so that the weight falls down your legs and towards the ground. Feel the connective tissue channel the weight down towards your feet, the interlocking structure that makes your balance. Get off balance, and weave back to it. There’s no goal here, so take your time.

As you breathe up and down and feel the weight move, imagine your top vertebra was resting on a hook; tuck your chin in slightly to achieve this and feel your spine elongate and straighten. Your spine should resemble a pole that extends to the ground. Notice your skeletal structure, and the breath that drives movement along the connective tissue and muscle. Release whatever you’re holding and let gravity continue to melt your weight into the ground beneath your feet. Readjust as needed.

This should hurt a bit. The hard part is getting your weight to actually pour out through your feet and into the ground--it’s not a familiar feeling. Think of it as the tension pent up in your body, exiting in a directed fashion. The more you explore this, the more naturally you’ll be able to expel tension and maintain a sound posture.

The body becomes a refuge. One can sit for hours and not be bored or left wanting, because one can enter the body at will and be fully self-possessed.
This doesn't mean that the goal is to turn from the world and live only in the body, but rather that this internal awareness can open up a more fulfilled experience in the world.

You can do exercises like this one for an hour, or a few minutes, or 15 seconds. But work that awareness of your internal structure. Learn the shape of that landscape. Someday, it might even become a sort of background process which autonomously absorbs and releases tension and stress within the body. Today, it will keep you centered, relaxed, and clear-headed as you navigate these new waters.
