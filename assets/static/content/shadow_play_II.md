"*Je vous le dis, demain vous serez mobilisé. Pour vous et pour moi, cela est une libération. L’individu ne peut rien et pourtant il peut tout. Dans cette merveilleuse disponibilité vous comprenez pourquoi je l’exalte et l’écrase à la fois. C’est le monde qui le broie et c’est moi qui le libère. Je le fournis de tous ses droits.*" - Albert Camus, *Le Mythe de Sisyphe*

"*A Republic, if you can keep it.*" - Ben Franklin


The previous post, written well before the virus and its consequences, was about powers-that-be encouraging bloodshed and division. We are driven to insane positions by others who benefit from our reactions to this situation. When I wrote that, I believed we could still "opt out" and gain a measure of individual agency over the narratives that weave our common story. I no longer believe that.

Reading Michael Krieger's ["Farewell for Now"](https://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2020/07/09/farewell-for-now/), I realized I had been suppressing this exact conclusion:
> "I’ve concluded and admitted to myself that the general public is simply unwilling or unable to put aside petty differences to unite and effectively challenge the ruling class on the really big issues of the day."

It would be difficult to disagree with this assessment. People don't think about money, or goverment finances, so they don't see the generational looting that has occurred over the last several months. They don't think about surveillance and digital privacy, so they don't see the filter bubbles and echo chambers developing around their digital lives. More importantly, they project, interpreting the world in a way that agrees with their predisposition. They don't think about what is right because they prefer what is comfortable. What is effortless for their mindset.

This is where we lose the republic. I'm afraid it is now inevitable that we fragment into different "nations" with or without physical borders. Call it what you want: balkanization, the Patchwork Age, the American version of the Spanish Civil War. Given the tenor of the public discourse so far, I think we'll see each camp entrench further in its position and vision of what "the good" is. There's no solving this if we can't have dialogue, and we've completely lost both the willingness and venues to have _that_.
It's a gut-wrenching realization that the coming years (if not decades) will be marked by widespread institutional failure and the further breakdown of our common narratives. It may be more like _1984_. It may be more like _The Diamond Age_. No one knows. But hear me out: you must be clear-eyed about this. There are periods of history one can coast through, others one can ignore completely. The upcoming decades will be inevitable, and how we respond to them–the story we tell–will define the world we leave to our children.
