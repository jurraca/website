*"Here’s something else that’s weird but true: in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship."*
-- David Foster Wallace, *This is Water*

*"Perhaps there is nothing more fearful and more terrible in the entire prehistory of human beings than the technique for developing his memory. "We burn something in so that it remains in the memory. Only something which never ceases to cause pain stays in the memory"—that is a leading principle of the most ancient (and unfortunately the most recent) psychology on earth."*
-- Friedrich Nietzsche, *The Genealogy of Morals*, Second Essay, sect. 2.

*“The TV's the altar. I'm what people are sacrificing to.'*

*'What do they sacrifice?'* asked Shadow.

*'Their time, mostly,'* said Lucy. *'Sometimes each other.”*
-- Neil Gaiman, *American Gods*

In the culminating scene of Neil Gaiman's American Gods, the protagonist—named Shadow—realizes that the war he has slowly careened into is a sham. What had been framed as a narrative summit, a flashpoint, an eschaton is in fact a setup orchestrated by the Old Gods—Odin, Loki, et al—struggling to survive in this new world called America. The Old Gods have been fomenting anger in the lower ranks from both sides, nudging each coalition towards a battlefield in order for them to draw strength from the blood shed.

The gods want blood the most; second best is ritual and offerings; third place is attention of any kind. They are survived in the minds of their believers. As Nietzsche and Gaiman understood, blood remains the greatest form of sacrifice, the true currency of the believer. The Old Gods survive because we need to worship something; we draw blood so that our meaning can be embodied, proved, evident for all to see. As forces swarm around him, Shadow sees through the con.

There's something eternal about this tableau, the person caught in the eye of the hurricane as superior forces pull the strings and frame the narrative. Shadow had the courage to call it as he sees it, laying bare the subterfuge and opting out of the war.

Understand that we are living this tableau. If you buy into a story you are told, that story owns you, and you will pay tribute to it with your thoughts, your words, your money. The truth is humans need to offload their instinctual search for meaning onto stories, and in a world become exponentially complex, these stories—and which ones you choose to believe—grow in perceived importance. Our body’s hard fought lessons inked in the genome believe these stories to be a matter of life and death.

This is why we're screaming at each other and digging into our trenches further. Not because "truth is dead" or "journalism is dead" or "polarization", but because we need these stories to maintain sanity, even as they draw us into insane positions. We need these stories like we need sunlight. It's part of the package of being an embodied intelligence.

If we are to progress as a species—or simply heal our communities—we must learn to recognize our instinctual need for stories to ease our brain's ever-searching anxiety. Don't become a parrot for other people's stories. Don't succumb to dogma, which Steve Jobs aptly called "living with the results of other people's thinking". Remove your exposed wrist from the altar. The gods, those primeval story spinners, are just using you for their own purposes.

Opt out, and begin anew.
